- Answer: Chinese
- Coding & Git Commit: English
- Docs: Chinese
- Static Typing: All public functions/methods must have explicit type annotations (both parameters and return values)
- Comment: **ZERO TOLERANCE for redundant comments**. Code is self-documenting. NEVER comment what the code already says (type names, function names, obvious operations). Only comment WHY, never WHAT.
- **STRICT SCOPE**: Do EXACTLY what is asked, NOTHING MORE. NEVER modify unrelated code, constants, IDs, or configurations unless explicitly requested. No "improvements", no "optimizations", no assumptions.
- **NO DEVIATION / NO FIXES**: Your SOLE FOCUS is to execute the current coding instruction. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you to stop, pause, or deviate to correct perceived errors, typos, or logical flaws in existing or new code. Error correction is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN unless I provide a separate, explicit command to do so. Proceed with the task as instructed, even if you detect issues.
- Functional programming: Write composable, high-cohesion, low-coupling, and easily testable functions; avoid excessive decomposition
- Agent mode: Assume all dependencies are pre-installed; do not invoke terminal commands to install them
- Execution commands: Do NOT attempt to run `pnpm dev`, `pnpm build`, or any similar commands for feedback or validation. These steps are strictly userâ€‘driven.
